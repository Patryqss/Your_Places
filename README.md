This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Running the project

Before your first start of the app, run:

### `npm i`

You will have to get your own Google Api Key to run this application.<br /> 
Read how to do it here: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key

Once you get it, in the main folder, create .env file and paste this line there:

### `REACT_APP_GOOGLE_API_KEY = your_google_api_key`

Finally, in the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
